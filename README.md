# Time-energy Measurements of Shared-memory Applications on Modern Multicore Systems

This repository provides the time-energy data collected and analyzed in our research paper
entitled "The Time and Energy Efficiency of Modern Multicore Systems" (PARCO 2019).

## How to Use

To generate model data in `data/model` folder, go to scripts folder and run:

```
$ ./run_homogeneous.sh
$ ./run_heterogeneous.sh
```

You need `bash` and `Python (2.7)` to run these scripts.

Please read our [Data-in-Brief article](article.pdf) for a detailed description of the data.
